Directly at the intersection is a memorial commemorating the 370 people who died on July 30, 1943 in the bombed Karstadt bunker on Hamburger Straße.

Behind the shopping center _Hamburger Meile_ are numerous residential areas. A lot of red brick buildings, but in between older buildings with lots of stucco and decorations.

The _Alter Schützenhof_ (1867), located in a yellow painted building has a quite famous history: It was the pub of the professional criminal _Adolf Petersen_ (_Lord of Barmbeck_) and meeting place for criminals in the early 20th.

Later, he gave up his pub and devoted himself entirely to safe cracking and raids, which brought him repeatedly prison sentences, even once for 12 years. When he was imprisoned again in 1933, he hanged himself in the cell.

On the other side of canal in the courtyard of the _Museum für Arbeit_ stands the _T.R.U.D.E._ (Tief runter unter die Elbe, engl. deep down under the Elbe river). It is the former largest drill head in the world, with which the tubes of the Elbtunnel were dug.
