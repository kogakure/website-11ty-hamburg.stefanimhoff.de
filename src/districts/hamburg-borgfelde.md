_Borgfelde_ is divided into _upper_ and _lower Borgfelde_. The wealthy citizens used to live in beautiful houses on the hillside, and the workers lived in the lower _Borgfelde_. In between there is a steep slope called _Geesthang_.

Since large parts of _Borgfelde_ have fallen victim to the bombs, there are hardly any older houses, mostly 4-5 storey buildings of the postwar period. In the _upper Borgfelde_ in front of the _Geesthang_ there is a long park in which the sculpture _Drei Vogelsäulen für Borgfelde_ by _Klaus Becker_ stands. There are a number of benches along the park path, but the noise of _Borgfelder Straße_ makes it no pleasure to sit here.

On the wall of the _Erlöserkirche_ in the _Jungestraße_ there is the war victims memorial of _Hans Kock_.

In _Lower Borgfelde_ are hardly any residential buildings left, but mostly commercial ones: Many car dealerships, banks, office buildings, several schools, some offices and city buildings and the HCAT (_Hamburg Center of Aviation Training_).

To reach _Lower Borgfelde_ from _Upper Borgfelde_ there is only one stone staircase on the _Geesthang_.

Directly close to the S-Bahn and U-Bahn station _Berliner Tor_ there is a park and there is a round bunker from the war. It is not nice here, and the noise of the cars that drive from the _Elbbrücken_ to Hamburg and the numerous dirt and garbage only make sure that you only want to leave the park quickly.
