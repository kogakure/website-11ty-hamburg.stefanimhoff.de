Farmsen-Berne has a lot of _small garden clubs_, north of _Luisenhof_ are mostly 3-storey estates, moderately pretty, but mostly quiet.

East of _Strandbad Farmsen_ youâ€™ll find mostly single-family homes, well maintained and bourgeois. Even the driveways without a fence are symbolically locked with hanging chains.

Near the retention basin at _Berner Au_ there is a lot of forest (_Berner Wald_), beautiful settlements, but also some skyscrapers. The settlement north of Berner Wald is very beautiful and has well-kept houses.

The _Berner Gutspark_ is extremly well maintained and the most beautiful park in the entire district. It is suitable for relaxing and reading on the lawn in fine weather. It can be reached in a few minutes from the subway station _Berne_. In the middle of the park is the _Berner Gutshaus_.

The route along the metro line has mostly 3- or 4-story settlements.

There is a lot of green and peacefulness, good jogging trails along _Berner Au_. Many playgrounds, sports fields, adventure playgrounds and construction play grounds.
