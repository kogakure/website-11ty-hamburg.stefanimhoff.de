Already from a distance the minarets of the _Centrum-Mosque_ Hamburg can be seen. They were painted in 2009 as part of an art project with green and white hexagons.

_St. Georg_ is a neighborhood of contrasts: only a few meters away from the women's entrance of the mosque are gay and lesbian bars and pubs.

The further north in St. Georg, the _hipper_ gets the district. In _Steindamm_ there are countless Arabic, Turkish and Indian restaurants; Here you will find the most delicious kebab of the city. But there are also numerous erotic shops, sex clubs, numerous hotels and the cinema _Savoy_, in which many films run in the original language.

_St. Georg_ has some of the most beautiful façades in late-Classicist style, especially around the _Hansaplatz_, _Steinplatz_, _Brennerstraße_ and _Lange Reihe_.

_St. Georg_ owes its name to a leprosy hospital founded in 1194 outside the walls of Hamburg, which was dedicated to _Saint George_. The Asklepios hospital stays true to this tradition. There are also numerous Stifte (chapters) in _St. Georg_, founded by wealthy merchants for the needy.

St. Georg is where multicultural diversity is lived out: lesbian and gay couples strolling hand in hand, fully-tattooed-full-bearded fathers with several children, skaters with headphones, heavily veiled Muslim women.

Only a _Waffen verboten_ (Weapons prohibited) sign, that prohibits pistols, knives, baseball bats and pepper spray, suggests that things may not always be peaceful here at night.
