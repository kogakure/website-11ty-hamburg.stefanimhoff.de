Many houses in Rotherbaum are extremely beautiful and well maintained. In the Milchstra√üe is the _Villa Beit_, which looks almost like a small castle.

In Feldbrunnenstrasse there is an extraordinary building: The Chinese Teahouse _Yu Garden_ with the typical curved roof gables, stone lion statues and round gates. From there in a curve back to the south, past the _Museum of Ethnology Hamburg_.
