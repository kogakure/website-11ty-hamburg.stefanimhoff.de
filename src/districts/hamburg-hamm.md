The majority of _Hamm_ was destroyed by _Operation Gomorrah_ in 1943, so there are only occasionally old-style houses here and there. Besides that there are a lot of brick buildings, but also plastered houses. Many apartments have really small windows and I could often see that the light was switched on during bright daylight.

_Hammer Park_ is a very nice and big park in Hamm. In addition to a larger pond, there is also a beautiful flower and hedge garden, a playground, several meadows, a mini golf course and table tennis. Next to the children’s playground is a memorial stone for _Joachim Heinrich Campe_.

In Hamm is the _Döhnerstraße_, which did not get its name from the Döner kebab, but from _Friedrich Adolf Döhner_, a merchant and politician.

In the south of Hamm is a shelter and the properties of the police dog sports club. South along the _Bille_ there are only large areas of small garden clubs, as well as on the _Billerhuder Insel_ (which belongs to _Rothenburgsort_). Countless yachts are anchored on the banks here, and families drive their boats around the canals.

In the western part of _Hamm-Süd_ there are only commercial areas. Numerous warehouses, printshops, sailing clubs and a huge area of nudist nightclub _Babylon_.
