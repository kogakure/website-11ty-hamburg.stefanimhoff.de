At Rothenburgsort the _Bille_ river flows into the _Elbe_ river, which is why there is a lot of private boat traffic. The numerous small garden clubs on _Billenhuder Insel_ - if they have access to the Bille - almost always have a jetty and often motorboats.

The north of Rothenburgsort has large areas of industrial and commercial properties. South of the _Billekanal_ the industrial and commercial area continues and is traversed by large track systems.

South of the tracks there are some residential areas. The landmark of Rothenburgsort can also be seen from here: the 64 meter high water tower on the grounds of the waterworks.

There are some beautiful green areas in _Elbpark Entenwerder_ and the _Billwerder Buch_ leads to the _Elbinsel Kaltehofe_, where a Museum of Water Art is located. Further south there is a protected freshwater cove in the _Holzhafen_. This was created as an equalization area for other areas.
