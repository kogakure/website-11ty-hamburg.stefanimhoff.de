Hammerbrook has predominantly commercial and industrial sites: a large fruit trade at the Oberhafen, only very few apartments, but old factory buildings and large warehouses.

The city is crossed by several train tracks, both the S-Bahn from the main station to the south, as well as the tracks of the Deutsche Bahn. The tracks run at height on bridges over the city.

There are hardly any houses in _Hammerbrook_, just over 2,000 people live in the large district, most of the houses are in very poor condition and offer little desirable living space.

From the bridges over the _Hochwasserbassin_ allow a fantastic view of the _Berliner Bogen_. Further to the east of _Hammerbrook_ are companies like Stadtreinigung and _SVG-Hamburg Straßenverkehrsgenossenschaft_. There is also an event location, which is located in an old warehouse and can be booked for fashion shoots or the like.

If you want to register your car or need a license plate, you will also have to drive to this part of _Hammerbrook_. Around the registration office all sorts of car dealerships, TÜV Hanse, shops for signs or rapid approvals have settled.

At the _Berufliche Schule Recycling- und Umwelttechnik_, which sits in parts in a beautiful old brick building with ornate decorations, a huge robot made of pieces of scrap metal looks down on visitors.

On the bank of the _Victoriakais_ (to be seen well from the _Wendenbrücke_) several floating houses (_Floating Homes_) are anchored. Here you can visit the different models before buying such a house.
