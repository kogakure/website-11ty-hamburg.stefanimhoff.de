On the courtyard of the _Museum der Arbeit_ stands the _T.R.U.D.E._, the boring head of the Elbtunnel drill, which drilled the 4th Elbtunnel tube. It has an impressive 14.2 meters in diameter, weighs 380 tons and was in use from October 1997 to March 2000.

In Barmbek-Nord, everything is built in red brick, in parts really pretty and in a variety of reds and patterns, so that no uniformity arises.

Behind the former _Margarine Factory Voss_, where now _Techniker Krankenkasse_ is is a small garden club.

The _Bürgerhaus Barmbek_ has columns and railings which are completely covered with knitted patterns.

South of the _Asklepios Kliniken_ and west of the _Wasserturm Palais_ is a really nice residential area, extremely quiet with classical, listed buildings. But if you want to live there, you have to dig deep into your pocket (5 rooms, 2 bathrooms, 160m² for about 2,500 € per month).
