Marienthal is purely a residential area, but a better one. There are many restored, beautiful buildings, clean and well maintained.

Everything is well secured, alarm systems and warning signs against burglars everywhere. A lot of expensive cars in the driveways. The closer you get to the highway the less nice the houses are.

There are two geometric parks with lakes, in one of which stands the _Husarendenkmal_.

At the highway a huge sound barrier was built, which is very ugly. It’s also still quite loud there.

Nearby, the Siel was redone, the dug out tubes were huge.

In the _Wandsbeker Gehölz_ it is nice and quiet, there are several lakes and many people were around on a Sunday. Along the forest there are many retirement homes.

Near Wandsbek station there is a bizarre traffic control: an tunnel for pedestrians, above that the tracks of the Deutsche Bahn and on top a freeway.
