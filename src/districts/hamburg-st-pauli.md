The _Millerntor_ used to be the western of the Hamburg city gates. There is the last remaining northern guardhouse, which was built by Carl Ludwig Wimmel.

The park _Planten un Bloomen_ has a lot of very nice parks and gardens: _Rosengarten_, _Apothekergarten_, _Japanese garden_ with a _Tea house_.

St. Pauli is a progressive-left district full of graffiti. Not a single surface seems to be spared and unfortunately, only a few have artistic quality. In addition, anti-capitalist posters, sticky notes, and messages are pinned everywhere, and one always encounters maliciously destroyed things. Bicycles are the most common victim here.

In the middle of St. Pauli are the _Hamburger Dom_ and the _Millerntorstadium_. _Hamburger Dom_ takes place three times a year and lasts about a month each. During this time the _Heiligengeistfeld_ is built up with all kinds of stalls and rides. The _Millerntorstadium_ is the home of the _FC St. Pauli_, a soccer club with probably the most loyal fans nationwide.

The closer one comes to the red light district of St. Pauli, the more degenerate are the streets. And especially a constant smell of urine in the corners is quite annoying. St. Pauli has had a problem with _Wildpinklers_ for years, no wonder, as more than 20 million guests come to St. Pauli every year. In 2015, the project _St. Pauli pisst zurück_ (St. Pauli pisses back) was founded and painted an unknown number of walls with special paint.

This paint ensures that the urine just pours off and injects the Pinkler directly onto his own shoes and pants. In addition, even three years later you can still see warning signs and advertising posters everywhere, which suggests that the project did not really solve the problem.

Even in the afternoon the _Reeperbahn_ and the adjacent streets are already well visited. Even at this time, heavily intoxicated people are pouring into pubs, clubs, gambling halls or brothels.

_St. Pauli Elbtunnel_ connects _Steinwerder_ through a tunnel below the Elbe river which one can go on foot, by bicycle and during the week by car on a one-way street.
