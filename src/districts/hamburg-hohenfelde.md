_Hohenfelde_ was destroyed during _Operation Gomorrah_ in 1943 up to 70 percent, which is why the majority of the houses are build in the clinker brick building of the post-war period, but there also a few newer buildings in between. Especially beautiful are the houses that have survived the bombing. The closer you get to _Uhlenhorst_, the more of it is preserved.

Directly at the _Alster_ is the _Alsterwiese Schwanenwik_. It is a popular place for meeting people, barbecue or picnics.

Directly at the shore is the bronze sculpture _Drei Mann im Boot_ by _Edwin Scharff_. A little further afield, one of the _Vier Männer auf Bojen_ by _Stephan Balkenhol_.
